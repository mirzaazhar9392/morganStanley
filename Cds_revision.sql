--Collection of record information.

--Database
--if we are storing data at one place then it is called as Database.
--for ex: Excel, word ,text file etc.

--Disadvantages
--1.Data Accessibility is slow and Time consuming.
--2.It will Store very less amount of data
--3.No Relationship between two files.

--RDBMS(Relational Data Base Management System) - (Database)
--It is used to store structure data or it is collection of table related information.
--Structure data is nothing but data which store in rows and columns.
--Whatever the data we are storing inside RDBMS, to extract data we have simple langugae called SQL.

--NULL values
--A column with NULL value is a column with NO VALUE.
--While inserting values into table column, if we have not mentioned a value for a particular column
--then by default SQL will replace with a NULL value for those columns.
--NULL values used as Placeholder for unknown or inapplicable values.
--It is not possible to test NULL values by using SQL comparision operator.
--In order to test or extract null values from table we have to use below functions
--1.IS NULL
--2.IS NOT NULL
select * from Student where Student_Name = NULL
--We want to find Null value in student_Name column
--Find out NULL records in student_Name column?

--There are various types of constraints
--1.Primary Key
--2.Foreign Key
--3.NULL key
--4.Unique Key
--5.Default Key
--6.Check Key
--1.Primary Key(PK)
--NOT NULL + UNIQUE
--PK Constraint uniquely identifies each record in database table.
--PK is used mostly with numeric values.
--A table can have only one PK but we can define PK multiple columns at a time.

--1.UNION
--The UNION operator combines the result sets of two or more SELECT statements into a single result set. 
--It removes duplicate rows from the final result.

--2.UNION ALL
--UNION ALL does not remove duplicate rows from the final result. 
--It simply combines the result sets of multiple SELECT statements,

--UNION ALL is useful when you want to combine the results of multiple SELECT statements and retain all rows, 
--even if there are duplicates.

--3.INTERSECT
--The INTERSECT operator returns only the distinct rows that appear in both result sets of the SELECT statements. 
--It selects the common rows while eliminating duplicates.

--OVER clause
--The OVER clause is a clause used in SQL to perform calculations and aggregations over a specific 
--set of rows 
--within a query result. 
--It is commonly used in conjunction with window functions, 
--which are analytical functions that operate on a "window" of rows defined by the OVER clause.

--Syntax:
--<function> OVER (PARTITION BY <column(s)> ORDER BY <column(s)>)

--components of the OVER clause:
--<function>: This represents the window function that will be applied to the rows defined by the window frame. 
--			   Examples of window Function Count(),AVG(),MAX(),MIN(),SUM(),RANK(),Dense_Rank() and ROW_NUMBER() etc
--PARTITION BY: This is an optional part of the clause that allows you to divide the rows into partitions or groups 
--              based on one or more columns. The window function will be calculated separately for each partition. 
--				If not specified, the entire result set is considered as a single partition.
--ORDER BY: This specifies the column(s) used to order the rows within each partition. 
--			The window function is applied in the order defined by this clause.

--Use:
--The OVER clause allows you to perform calculations and aggregations over specific subsets of rows within a query, 
--enabling powerful analytical capabilities. It is commonly used for tasks like calculating running totals, 
--cumulative sums, averages, rankings.

--Q.Is it possible to use the DISTINCT clause together with TOP in SQL Server to retrieve a limited number
--of unique rows? If yes, provide an example.
/*Yes, it's possible to use the DISTINCT clause together with the TOP clause in 
SQL Server to retrieve a limited number of unique rows.
The DISTINCT clause ensures that only unique rows are considered, and the TOP clause limits the number of
results returned.*/
SELECT TOP 5 DISTINCT CategoryID
FROM Sales

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
/*Q.How does the DISTINCT clause handle NULL values in the columns? Write a query 
to retrieve all distinct country names from the "Customers" table, considering that 
some customers might not have provided their country information (NULL).*/

/*The DISTINCT clause in SQL treats NULL values like any other distinct value. This means
that if you use DISTINCT to retrieve distinct values from a column that contains NULL values,
those NULL values will be treated as a unique value and will appear in the result set.
Keep this behavior in mind when working with the DISTINCT clause.*/

--Q.The "Products" table contains a column "category" and a column "price." Write an SQL query to retrieve
--all unique product categories where the average price of products in each category is greater than 100 rupees.

SELECT category FROM Products

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--Q.What is the difference between using the DISTINCT clause and the GROUP BY clause to retrieve unique 
--rows from a table? When would you use one over the other?
/*DISTINCT Clause:
The DISTINCT clause is used to eliminate duplicate rows from the result set. It considers all 
columns specified in the SELECT statement to determine uniqueness.
It's generally used when you want to retrieve a list of unique values based on one or more columns, 
without performing any aggregation or summarization.

GROUP BY Clause:
The GROUP BY clause is used to group rows that have the same values in specified columns into summary rows,
often with aggregate functions applied to other columns.
It's used when you want to perform aggregate calculations like SUM, COUNT, AVG, etc.,
on groups of rows based on certain columns.
It's more powerful than DISTINCT as it allows you to perform calculations and transformations
on groups of rows, and it provides control over how the data is summarized.*/

--Q.Can you use a WHERE clause in the SELECT statement of the INSERT INTO ... SELECT statement?
No, you cannot use a WHERE clause directly within the SELECT statement of the INSERT INTO ... SELECT statement.
The purpose of the INSERT INTO ... SELECT statement is to insert all rows returned by 
the SELECT statement into the target table, without further filtering or conditions
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--Q.What is the purpose of the INSERT INTO ... SELECT statement in SQL Server?
The INSERT INTO ... SELECT statement in SQL Server is used to copy data from one
or more source tables or queries and insert it into a target table. This statement allows
you to perform bulk inserts of data from one table or query result into another table,
which can be particularly useful for tasks such as data migration, data consolidation, 
or creating backup copies of data

INSERT INTO TargetTable (Column1, Column2, ...)
SELECT ColumnA, ColumnB, ...
FROM SourceTable
WHERE Condition;
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--Q.What is the key difference between the INSERT INTO ... SELECT statement and the INSERT INTO ... VALUEs
--statementINSERT INTO ... SELECT:

/*The INSERT INTO ... SELECT statement allows you to insert data into a table by selecting data from
one or more source tables or queries.
It is used for bulk inserts and is suitable for scenarios where you want to copy data from one table 
(or query result) into another table.
It's useful when you need to move or consolidate data, perform data integration, or apply 
transformations during the insertion process.

INSERT INTO ... VALUES:
The INSERT INTO ... VALUES statement allows you to insert data into a table by specifying 
explicit values for each column.
It is used for inserting individual rows of data with specific values.
It's useful for inserting a small number of rows, usually with predefined values,
without the need for a source table or query.*/

-- Using INSERT INTO ... SELECT
INSERT INTO TargetTable (FirstName, LastName, Age)
SELECT FirstName, LastName, Age
FROM SourceTable
WHERE Age > 30;

-- Using INSERT INTO ... VALUES
INSERT INTO TargetTable (FirstName, LastName, Age)
VALUES ('John', 'Doe', 35);
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--Q.Can you use a WHERE clause in the SELECT statement of the INSERT INTO ... SELECT statement?
No, you cannot use a WHERE clause directly within the SELECT statement of the INSERT INTO ... SELECT statement.
The purpose of the INSERT INTO ... SELECT statement is to insert all rows returned by 
the SELECT statement into the target table, without further filtering or conditions
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--Q.What happens if the source and target tables of the INSERT INTO ... SELECT statement
--have different column orders?
/*If the source and target tables of the INSERT INTO ... SELECT statement have different column orders, 
you need to ensure that the columns in the SELECT statement are matched correctly with the corresponding 
columns in the target table. The order of columns in the SELECT statement should match the order of columns 
in the target table's column list specified in the INSERT INTO clause.
If the columns are matched incorrectly or if there's a mismatch in the number of columns,
you might encounter errors or unexpected behavior. The database system will attempt to insert
data into columns based on their order in the SELECT statement.*/
-- Incorrect: Mismatched columns
INSERT INTO TargetTable (ColumnB, ColumnC, ColumnA)
SELECT ColumnA, ColumnB, ColumnC
FROM SourceTable;

-- Correct: Matching columns
INSERT INTO TargetTable (ColumnB, ColumnC, ColumnA)
SELECT ColumnB, ColumnC, ColumnA
FROM SourceTable;
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--Q.Can you insert data from multiple source tables into a single target table using INSERT INTO ... SELECT?
Yes, you can insert data from multiple source tables into a single target table using the INSERT INTO ... SELECT 
statement. This is useful when you need to combine data from different tables into one unified dataset. 
Each SELECT statement retrieves data from its respective source table, and the combined result sets are 
then inserted into the target table.

INSERT INTO TargetTable (Column1, Column2, ...)
SELECT ColumnA, ColumnB, ...
FROM SourceTable1;

INSERT INTO TargetTable (Column1, Column2, ...)
SELECT ColumnX, ColumnY, ...
FROM SourceTable2;

-- Repeat for other source tables if needed
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--Q.Can you achieve the same result with a subquery as you can with a JOIN?
/*Yes, you can achieve similar results using a subquery as you can with a JOIN, but the methods
and performance characteristics might differ. Both approaches allow you to retrieve data from multiple tables
based on certain conditions, but they have distinct use cases and considerations.

Using a JOIN:
A JOIN combines rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them.
JOINs are often used when you need to retrieve data from multiple tables and combine related information 
into a single result set.
Different types of JOINs (INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, FULL OUTER JOIN) provide various
ways to control how data from each table is matched and included in the result.
JOINs are typically more readable and intuitive when dealing with complex relationships and multiple tables.

Using a Subquery:
A subquery is a query embedded within another query. It's used to retrieve data that will be used
as a condition in the outer query.
Subqueries are often used when you need to filter or aggregate data from one table based on 
the results of another query.
Subqueries can be used in the SELECT, WHERE, or HAVING clauses of the outer query.
Subqueries can become complex and hard to read as the level of nesting increases.*/
